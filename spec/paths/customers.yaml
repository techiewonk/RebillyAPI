  summary: Create a customer (without an ID)
  description: |
    Create a customer without a predefined ID.  
    The customer's primary address
    will be used as the default address for payment
    instruments, subscriptions and invoices if none
    are provided.

    If you wish to create the customer with a predefined
    ID (which we recommend to prevent duplication), you 
    may use our `PUT` request described below.
