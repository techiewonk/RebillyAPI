      The type of transaction requested.
      You should always include the type within your API request.
      This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.  To refund or void, use the refund endpoint.
      To `capture` use the `sale` endpoint.  It will capture if there are any eligible
      transactions of type `authorize` that can be captured.
    type: string
    enum:
      - sale
      - authorize
      - credit
  amount:
    description: |
      The transaction amount.  Use `0` for a zero dollar verification. This is important if
      you want to authorize a payment instrument before giving access to a free trial, for example.

    format: double
  invoiceIds:
    description: |
      The array of invoice identifiers.  It's important to note that the transaction
      amount can be more or less than the combined invoice amounts.  If the transaction
      is a type `sale` and it is `approved` it will be applied to these invoices in
      the order of the first issued invoice to the most recently issued invoice.  If
      there are enough funds to fully pay an invoice, the invoice status will be marked
      as paid.

  requestId:
    description: The request id is **recommended**. It prevents
      duplicate transaction requests within a short period of time.
      If a duplicate request is sent with the same `requestId` it
      will be ignored to prevent double-billing anyone.  It must
      be unique within a 24-hour period.  We recommend generating
      a UUID v4 as its value.

  notificationUrl:

      The URL where a server-to-server notification request type `POST` with an empty body will be sent
      when the transaction's result is finalized. Do not trust the notification;
      follow with a `GET` request to confirm the result of the transaction.  Please respond with a `2xx`
      HTTP status code, or we will reattempt the request again.
